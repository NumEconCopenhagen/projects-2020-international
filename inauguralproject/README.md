# Inaugural project

This project is focused on learning how to create algorithms in order to optimize desired paramaters. The main point of this project is optimizing the labor supply problem focusing on optimal consumption and labor supply given a wage rate and other paramaters. We are all other parameter values essential to the model except consumption and labor supply. However, in this project we will also analyze how adjusting these paramaters impact the final results and if we can optimize the known paramaters to maximize tax revenenue.
