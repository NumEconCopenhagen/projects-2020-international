# Data analysis project

Our project is titled Data Analysis: Danish Drug Price analysis on Abilify and focuses on analyzing the price per dosage of the Drug Abilify between firms in the Danish Drug price dataset lmpriser_eSundhed_200323.xlsx. Abilify was chosen because there are many firms throughout 2015 to 2020 that sold the drug. The dataset contains descriptive variables of each drug such as the unique product number and form to quantitative variables on producer selling and consumer purchasing price. We want to determine how the same drug can vary in price across producers and if there are any notable insights to be found within or between producers of Abilify. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We conclude:
Taking a quick look at the data, prices per dosage appear to have way higher volatility than expected as they tend to increase and decrease rather rapidly, a trend that most firms seem to follow. Abilify had an average price of around 70 DKK per daily dosage and it presents a left skewed distribution which indicates that it was most often sold for even less, leaving some extremely higher values acting as outliers.
Results are far from expected since its prices’ high variance is not what a traditional economic theory would predict. As that good could be characterized as both essential and competitive it would be expected to present limited flexibility.  Further research would be interesting to be done both in terms of its prices’ correlation with the general medicine market prices as well as with its’ direct substitutes and consumers’ demand.
