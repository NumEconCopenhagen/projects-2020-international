# Data analysis project

Our project is titled Data Analysis: Danish Drug Price analysis on Abilify and focuses on analyzing the price per dosage of the Drug Abilify between firms in the Danish Drug price dataset lmpriser_eSundhed_200323.xlsx. Abilify was chosen because there are many firms throughout 2015 to 2020 that sold the drug. The dataset contains descriptive variables of each drug such as the unique product number and form to quantitative variables on producer selling and consumer purchasing price. We want to determine how the same drug can vary in price across producers and if there are any notable insights to be found within or between producers of Abilify.
